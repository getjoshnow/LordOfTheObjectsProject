# LordOfTheObjectsProject
### Overview
Welcome to The Mario 1981
This is a java-based game that allows the user navigate linear game.
The player must fight Mario themed enemies who have health and attack damage. The user has 4 available commands, which respond differently per each opponent.
The game continues until user defeats all 3 enemies or is defeated themselves.  Upon victory, Mario rescues the princess.
The game has implemented simple strategies that makes it a challenge to find which attack is most effective against a enemy.
Each time an enemy is hit, it will strike back, unless it is defeated. The enemies have random responses to make the game less predictable.

## Lord of the Objects Project

Week 2 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp.
Mario themed text based game designed for the user to defeat opponents and utilize basic strategies to achieve objects.

### Lessons Learned
I learned more about to design a linear game solely with Object Oriented programming.  The approach involved creating class and Objects and transferring data between methods.  I learned that it is much easier to track data points within long programs, and that protecting your data is essential to the creation process.  Protecting data allows us to confidently build foundations upon which a program is better then the sum of its parts.
This was truly a fun program.  Joe and I, also learned to divide work respective and to tackle a single program without duplicate code.




### Attack Plan
My programming partner, Joe, and I first created a UML diagram to layout a linear game structure and to identify the classes, methods, and variables we would be using.  We then took the classes and set them up in a way that we could take advantage of inheritance and minimize the amount of duplicated work.  Through encapsulation, we were able to secure our work and make our field variables protected so only our package would be able to access them.

Once we had the different classes set up, we were able to create a main method with the game flow and instantiate various objects to take on properties of their different classes so we could use them in our game.  Once we had the main outline structured and all the objects instantiated, we could focus on the storyline, the user experience, and some of our stretch goals.
